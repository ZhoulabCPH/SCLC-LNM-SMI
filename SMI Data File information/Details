Column descriptions:
fov
The Field Of View (FOV) the transcript is in. All FOVs from the sample are contained within this transcript file.
cell_ID
Unique identifier for a single cell within a given FOV. To make a unique identifier for a cell within the whole sample use both the “fov” and “cell_ID” columns. Transcripts not assigned to cells have a value of 0.
x_local_px
The x position of this transcript within the FOV, measured in pixels. To convert to microns multiply the pixel value by 0.12 um per pixel. For FOV-local coordinates, the origin (0,0) is the top left of the FOV.
y_local_px
Same as “x_local_px” but for the y dimension. Due to differences in Cartesian and imaging plotting frames of reference, the local y-axis coordinates should be inverted to align the transcript positions to images.
x_global_px
See “x_local_px” description. The global positions describes the relative position of this transcript within the large sample reference frame. For global coordinates, the origin (0,0) is the bottom left of the capture area.
y_global_px
Same as “x_global_px” but for the y dimension
z
The Z-slice image number. This has an arbitrary unit.
target
The gene detected. HUGO gene symbols are used.
CellComp
The subcellular compartment (Nuclear, Membrane, Cytoplasmic, or None) in which the transcript was detected as determined by cell segmentation algorithm. In this dataset, subcellular locations were not calculated.
